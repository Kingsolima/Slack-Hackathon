Prompt-injection detector — three layers (docs.md §Prompt Injection Detector):
  1. Regex signature scan for known patterns
  2. Claude semantic analysis for novel attempts
  3. Source-trust weighting by message origin

The regex layer and the trust math are pure functions so they can be unit-tested
without any API calls.
